Lab Reflection

During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control more effectively. I practiced creating and editing files, tracking changes with commits, and pushing updates to GitHub. I also gained hands-on experience with branches, which allowed me to experiment safely without affecting the main project. Merging branches taught me how collaboration works in real projects. Overall, this lab gave me confidence in using Git for managing my code.
